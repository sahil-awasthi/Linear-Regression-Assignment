## General Information
- This project is based on a bike-sharing dataset from BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider.
- The project aims to understand the factors affecting the demand for shared bikes and predict future demand.
- The dataset contains daily bike demand data based on various factors like weather, season, holiday, and more.

## Conclusions
- The demand for shared bikes is higher during the summer and fall seasons.
- Temperature and apparent temperature significantly influence the demand.
- The year variable shows an increasing trend in bike demand over time.

## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.11.7
- pandas - version 2.1.4
- scikit-learn - version 1.2.2
- matplotlib - version 3.8.0
- seaborn - version 0.12.2

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by the need to understand bike-sharing demand dynamics.
